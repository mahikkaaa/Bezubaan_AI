# BeZubaan: AI Model for Animal Injury Detection

![BeZubaan Logo](insert_logo_url_here)

## Project Overview

BeZubaan is an AI-powered project aimed at improving animal welfare by developing an artificial intelligence model capable of detecting injuries and distress in animals. 
The project's goal is to provide timely care and attention to animals that cannot verbally communicate their pain or suffering, thereby saving lives and reducing animal suffering.

### Key Features

- Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for image analysis.
- Detects injuries and distress in animals with high accuracy.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for real-time injury assessment.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebooks
- GitHub (for version control)
- NVIDIA GPUs (for model training)

## Getting Started

To get started with BeZubaan, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Bezubaan_AI-Model.git


2. Set up the Python environment:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To use BeZubaan, follow these steps:

- Run the Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Provide images of animals for injury detection, and BeZubaan will provide real-time assessment results.

Data
BeZubaan relies on a carefully curated dataset of animal images for training and evaluation. You can obtain the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats . Be sure to follow any licensing or usage restrictions associated with the dataset.

Model Architecture
BeZubaan employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image classification. The model consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification.

Results
BeZubaan's AI model achieves remarkable results in detecting injuries and distress in animals. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, are provided in the project's documentation.
