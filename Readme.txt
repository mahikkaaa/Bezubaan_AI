# BeZubaan: AI Model for Animal Injury Detection

![BeZubaan Logo](insert_logo_url_here)

## About BeZubaan

BeZubaan is an innovative project focused on improving animal welfare through the use of artificial intelligence. The project's primary objective is to develop an AI model capable of detecting injuries and distress in animals, enabling timely care and support for those unable to communicate their suffering verbally.

## Key Features

- Utilizes advanced deep learning techniques for image analysis.
- Achieves high accuracy in detecting injuries and distress in animals.
- Offers a user-friendly interface for real-time injury assessment.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebooks
- GitHub (for version control)
- NVIDIA GPUs (for model training)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with BeZubaan:

### Prerequisites

To run BeZubaan, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebooks

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone the BeZubaan repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bezubaan.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use BeZubaan, follow these steps:

1. Run the Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

2. Provide images of animals for injury detection, and BeZubaan will provide real-time assessment results.

## Data

BeZubaan relies on a carefully curated dataset of animal images for training and evaluation. You can obtain the dataset [insert_dataset_link_here]. Be sure to follow any licensing or usage restrictions associated with the dataset.

## Model Architecture

BeZubaan employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image classification. The model consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification.

## Results

BeZubaan's AI model achieves remarkable results in detecting injuries and distress in animals. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, are provided in the project's documentation.
