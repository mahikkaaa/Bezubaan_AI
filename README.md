# Bezubaan - Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview

Bezubaan is a project that demonstrates image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In this project, we use TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a CNN model to classify images of cats and dogs. The goal is to create a model that can accurately distinguish between these two classes.

## Dataset

We used the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset, which can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats). This dataset contains thousands of images of cats and dogs, making it suitable for training and testing our image classification model.

## Getting Started

To replicate or build upon this project, follow these steps:

1. **Data Download**: Download the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset from Kaggle using the provided URL.

2. **Data Preparation**: Organize the dataset into a train and test split. You can follow the directory structure used in the code for easy integration.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize the image data to values between 0 and 1 for improved model training. This preprocessing step is essential for training deep learning models.

4. **Model Architecture**: We implemented a CNN model with three convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is designed to learn features from the input images and make predictions.

5. **Model Training**: Compile and train the CNN model using the training dataset. We used the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss for training. You can adjust the number of epochs based on your specific requirements.

6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on the validation dataset to assess its accuracy and performance.

## Model Summary

The CNN model architecture used in this project is summarized as follows:
